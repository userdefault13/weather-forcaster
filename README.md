## Description
The project aims to provide a 5-day weather forecast for a specific city. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data and forecast information. Users can search for a city, and the application displays the current weather conditions along with a 5-day forecast.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Bootstrap 4 framework for responsive design. It incorporates AJAX requests to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updates the user interface to display the retrieved weather information.

The application also includes a search history feature, allowing users to view their recent searches. The search history is stored in the browser's local storage, providing a convenient way to access previously searched cities.
